Some Epistomological Diss Limericks

You thought you learned 'bout logic
Maybe back oh-eight or nine
Reading on the internet of all idiots behind
The church, the state, and everywhere
You brain it got so swoll
But really you're just shoving words through moon and star-shaped holes

"To the man!" he cried in Latin hoping to appear
Clev'rer than he was and more impressive to the ear
And then of course he made another spirited call, "ad-hom!"
And said that insults wouldn't work to prove the preacher wrong
The reply that came again at him (because *of course* it's "he")
Said in English, "you're not wrong cause you're an idiot you see"
"You're not the winner honeybear; the thing you say is wrong"
"And the the idiocy that trails you simply hums and tags along"

Crouching in the corner, like a vicar with a cross
Shouting incantations no one listening has a stake in
"The case is clear! The findings favor doing x not y!"
But what about reviews, beloved? What about equivocation?
To circle back and ask what separates you from the clergy
And why I'm so intent to tell you that your brain could use some fattenin'
The difference now, beloved, 'tween the Vicar and his foil
Is the Vicar--for his failings, cosmologically--knows Latin

"Your epistomolgy's so big and girthy!" You hoped that they'd all gush
But when you stuck it in their brains It didn't hit the spot
Instead of bringing karmic moans from discourse admir'bly writ
Everyone's left wanting, wond'ring if what the fuck they heard they thought
Not a Plato, not a Nietzche, nor enlightened smarmy Brit
Just another fucking mother's son who couldn't find the clit
