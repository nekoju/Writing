Here are the things I've done/been, in approximately chronological order,
failing my shitty memory.

1. A shitty annoying baby with curls
2. A shitty annoying kid with big ears
3. A shitty, but less shitty by means of transferent guilt, teenager.
4. A dad! (Naught else matters!)
5. A baker!
6. A bicycle manufartist
7. Who cares.
8. Grad school
9. #nihilism
10. #sluttynihilism
11. *chaos reigns*
12. I've still never seen that movie all the way but #penetration
13. #buddha_but_camus_boner

Anyway, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing, or will do, or anything else.
I'm just trying to be heard. And that's all I want.

Because I'm fucking lonely

But I'm sort of proud of myself
