What narcissus saw

I thought that if I just kept writing I would simply melt into the page and the horror of waking up would be replaced by the horrors I alluded to, which seemed at least more interesting.
But it's the same horrors, just viewed through a kaleidoscope filled with teeth, with a lens smeared with confetti, Vaseline, and bile.
When god does that gag it looks less like Abbott & Costello and more like a money shot filmed by Cronenberg.
And I've been fending off stares and picking off little bits of colored paper from my eyelids ever since.
