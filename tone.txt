A donkey went a-coppin' and they did ride, ah-hum
Policin' of the tone set in the movement far and wide, ah-hum
Ignorin' their fermentin' cognitive dissonance inside, ah-hum
And they deigned to but respond
Because the lilies at the pond
Were occupied by those with bigger pictures in their mind, ah-hum
