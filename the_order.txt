We picture the cenobites as grotesque representations of curious, counterdivine experimentation. Genital scarification or an eternal unnumbed vivisection on a couture leather table. "We have such sights to show you."

But surely as physical suffering is a realm to be explored, the suffering of the mind and the soul bears consideration. We can easily picture a literal human heart sliced and pinned however carefully or haphazardly by the whim of the Leviathan. What is less obvious is the figurative equivalent. What does it look like to have one's humanity flayed alive by an incomprehensible Victorian physiologist with a magnifying glass and tweezers? What oddly specific torments await the minds of explorers--however intrepid or eternally reluctant--of the boundaries of pleasure and pain? What inexplicably holds the seams of their sanity to grant them the presence to prod and provoke mortals? The same sensory Counternirvana that continually allays a second or third death?

Do they greet grief with mere (divine?) curiosity? The ponderance of an old lover in a new way, is this merely a new needle shape to be guided between little vesicles just under the surface? When they recall the bargain that placed them in their role, do they weep? Do they engage the same machinery that sees them face their further peeling winceless? Does the sound of porcelain smashing just above their head and the memory of the context that saw it send them outside of themselves, peering over the ledge into their present abyss to experience the call of the void of lonely adolescence again?
