Someone wrote about a torch up on a table, hidden by a basket
And all those songs the torchbearers sing are well equipped but not to ask us
What if we flipped the signs; naught being consumed but burning bigger dark, devourous?
What if it fails illumination, sucks the light it's given in around us?
What if the creatures dancing in the flicker of that which isn't light
Are horrors intersecting silhouettes we cast of dogs at night
What if instead of bringing warmth, my torch burns with cold and sooty sad
After that consideration, a basket doesn't seem so bad

Laid up turning on my hinges like an old but sturdy, worn-out hasp
Enshackled with a sturdy lock, enstamped with Title: "Master"
Brushed a string of the guitar held up on the plaster of the wall upon a hook drilled in
It sounded fine and took it down to strum a song with full humanity again
But appendages mismatched to task, my chitinious fingers made the metal of the meeting frets and strings
Grate out buzzing aren't-chords painfully, cacophonically
To the Sage's twisted wisom I should join the crowd and strum
But the crowd needs competent human strummers, not roaches cracking bubblegum

Perhaps inseperable, perhaps our solid shafts were bound with rotting cord
Perhaps the light that we put out was less than what our mismatch could afford
Upon assessing for a minute whether mine was good or bad
Evaluating amplitude and wavelength of the only rotten light I had
Mistakenly assumed that others cared to share my glow
But beloved, fire's born of one or many precious things
Like fuel and oxygen and matches struck with grace or reckless, scared intensity
Not least of all, combustion's born of shredding what you see
