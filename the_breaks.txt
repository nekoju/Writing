Sometimes when the big ones come themselves upon the shakes
They'll cut ya loose and tell ya' glibly, "sorry' them's the breaks"
And now you're out upon your ass a tryin' to get by
And they won't care until it comes and fucks their bottom line
But ticklin' just the rarest pencil-pusher's legal drawers
Will show them, for the bigger ones, sometimes when it rains, it pours
