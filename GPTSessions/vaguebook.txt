I can't believe I need to say this but..

Assuming you know someone's gender better than they do if ignorant at best. Actively dissemeninating a narrative counter their identity amounts to social sabatoge and is an act of transphobic violence and just incredibly shitty.

So, for those who do not already know, I am not a man and don't use masculine pronouns. You don't have to fucking understand it, but you certainly don't get to decide what I am for me and then build that narrative for others, no matter how fucking self-assuredly woke you are. Fucking Christ
