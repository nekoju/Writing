So there's this manager at the liquour store
Fucking joyless
Like just like a black hole of abject cynicism
So, in parallel, I'm noticing this thing called "Sippin' Cream"
Jesus I don't know what the fuck that is
So I walked up with my ... Hurricane...
... and I said, "So apparently there is a product here called 'sippin' cream'"...
I don't know why I do this. Well, I appreciate banal absurdity and assume others do too
And a bitch just needs to entertain herself
I said "...."
".. and that is about the most disgusting thing I've ever heard of."
And she replies, with a shrug, she says "Lots of people buy it."
In just about the most diabolical existential thud.
Christ, lady
WE'RE FUCKING SHARING MEMES HERE
Like, one karmic transducer to another, up your fucking game
Ok but then I start wondering, "maybe there's like another side"
"Maybe she's just checked out from capitalism and I should admire this person"
"And as a correlary, maybe there are people who LOVE this woman and bask in her prickliness with champagne and cigars"
"MAYBE THEY'RE MOCKING ME AND MY ABSURD SENSIBILITIES?!"
"Maybe she has someone to go home to?"
"Maybe she really likes karaoke?"
"Maybe I'm actually an asshole who isn't very funny?" [silence, plausible]
Or maybe I should just delight in the absurd sexuality of calling a product ''sippin' cream''
(pulls out sippin cream)
