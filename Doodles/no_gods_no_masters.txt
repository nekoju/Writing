To Whom it May Concern

No gods, no Masters
No Doctors, no sirs
No Colonels, no Mrs. whatever you were
By virtue of marrying someone more good
Than me with no money
Or a dude with a hood

No Generals, no Esquires
No Bosses, no Chefs
No Pastors whether set on the right or the left
Of the class and the culture war raging again
With every latent acknowledgement
You're lesser than them

No privilige of money
No privilige of birth
Just people with baggage on a rock made of dirt
That bore me and bore you and bore whom you address
But pander away
Good Sir, I digress
