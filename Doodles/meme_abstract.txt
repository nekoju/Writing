The Cosmic Meme

The memeist's creation is legion, swarming the infinite shore like a creeping and lovable mass of baby sea turtles to the gulls' oblivion or the promise of a life of absolute freedom to be.

The memest's act is one of prideless love of creation, forever torn from its mother by the creative chaos of the evolutionary ecology of culture. In never being meaningfully atomically attributable to the memeist--where would she put her initials--the meme exists as a being of cultural and chemical energy stored only in our collective consciousness and the electrical states of the capitalist infrastructure it subverts.

The MEME--that higher-order consciousness of pure, impulsive creation or rapturous frustration--exists as its own organism, one that swells and subsumes and assimilates and inspires transparently. To "get it" is not to appreciate the art itself, but its soul, which is the soul of the connected world.

It is immune to gatekeeping. The medium is almost definitionally low-effort, low-investment. It is a burst of karmic absurdity directly intended to be transduced into its rawest intelligible emotional form. The grammar and rhetoric of the MEME's symbolism are inherently subversive and written in the language of integrative sensory wit.

So, with the following value judgements:
- Art > artifice, i.e., the spiritual content of art is more important than the technical skill that created it
- Art that serves an explicit conversational social purpose that provokes engagement > art that is meant to be "viewed"
- Art that is unconstrained by normative artistic sensibilities, i.e. "freer" > art that relies heavily on convention
