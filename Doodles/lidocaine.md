# Lidocaine

I felt her breath and tongue intermittently follow a contour from behind my knee to where the shadow of the abuttment of my thighs fanned out onto the alluvial plain of my inguinal hip.
The faint line of breathy saliva formed a zipper and the skin of my right thigh unfurled like a flag as she looked up from my pelvis into my soul.
With no pain, and only the soothing and jarring, cold, tense and curious unease of lidocaine in a deep flesh wound you might brag about the number of stitches required by which tomorrow.
Surprised to see the skin intact, but out of focus just behind her head, another jaw shot and I fall into a vat of syrup that decelerates my skin and leaves my insides plumetting when she says, "You have a lot on your mind," and my insides are again outpaced by the plumetting of my soul.

"I sure do."

I wanted to tell her to be a good girl, and every read I have said she'd be into it. It's too late to ask. There's so much it's too late or too soon to ask. Will add to the list of whats-ifs ticking by in red and gold. Now the lidocaine is wearing off and the walls are breathing and sweating as I am, throbbing in red to an unseen alien klaxon and I'm being vivisected, flayed to the groin with a convenient zipper which I can now only feel for knowing it's raw.

"Do you like that."

"I do," I reply. And it's true; the nerves work, but the space along this pipeline bringing it to my brain burns with preoccupation, and then the space between my brain and mouth burns with the dread of miscommunication and judgement and "I do" is laden with unasked-for caveats that no one but me will ever hear, and they sublimate into my blood to mingle with the lidocaine from before.

"...but I'm afraid."

And because I say I do she continues.

"...but I don't know what to do now."

And there is some kind of transition because someone is sore somewhere.

"...but I am wrong and broken for liking it."

She asks me what I want.

"...but I want to stop because of all those things I just said but I know I shouldn't give in to this and it isn't exactly a violation of consent, nor would I want it to be perceived that way because I have an intense second-order volition about it, and I'm fucking lonely."

So I say, "keep doing that." for the fear of asking for literally anything else and being seen.

"...but I'm about to ruin your life because of all that baggage."

So I lie there and enjoy it until it is over this time or for good, and resume longing.

"...but you deserve better."


Then Rapture.
