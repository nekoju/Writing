I've thought about his for years, but haven't done it because it's scary.
But I don't really feel like I have a choice.

I don't belong here. I've never belonged here. I'm an occasionally entertaining, mostly annoying bag of meat, the the reality is, absent any imposed spiritual incentive for the fetishization of chemistry, everyone here would be better off without me.
And it's fucking bullshit that I've allowed the biochemistry-fetishizing industrial complex the coerce me to stay here as long as I have.

And so, I'm leaving.

Fuck you. I'm not one of you. I wasn't meant for this. I wasn't meant for you.
Please just hate me and move one. I'm just meat. I was always just meat.

You can't just "Hey happy new year's eve" and then just clock out.
