The Old Man
05/13/2013

He came over on a boat, probably from Germany, before that from Manchester. I don't know when he arrived, only that he's old: perhaps half a century my senior. We have little in common, but I sit with him still, occasionally getting up to stretch my legs, a luxury he doesn't have.
Turn a wheel, flip a lever.
I hear his body protest as it moves, creaking and grinding with age, overuse, neglect. He groans as he works, oaken arms slowly, carefully up and down, less sure than they used to be, cretainly. Do-overs are common. Sapphire and topaz ferric scraps fall to the table as he whittles, the delicacy of dead leaves and the heft of tears. He finds a rhythm and sings as he works. Or is he crying? I hope for the former; there is no escaping this lot. He is Sisyphus cas in iron.
Walk over; take a look.
Turn a wheel, flip a lever.
He smells of oil, aluminum oxide, dust, and smoke. 1/32 at a time, almost there forever. He cuts a little more, creeping closer to passability, never perfection. His shaking hands must accept the limits imposed by expediency and the weather upstream. Devoted as he is, he will die here. Appreciated for what he does, never what he is, never the stories told by his sloughing layers, cobbled and recobbled nerves, faded placards with feeding instructions, and a fissured carapace.
Stop; take a measurement; start.
Turn a wheel; flip a lever.
Messages between each shift's operators scrawled in dandelion peek from beneath a decade of grime. Operating instructions long misplaced--were there ever any written? A saavy steelman can piece together instructions from half-sentence imperatives in marking paint. He can be massaged to reluctantly turn out another day's work with a squirt of oil here or a steel shim there. Worn and pitted ways and gears indicate favored positions and speeds like elongated notches on an old belt. He is history penned in steel.
The end is in sight. Soon, a rest.
