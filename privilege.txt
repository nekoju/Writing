A land of opportunity.
Nay, *The* land of opportunity.
We've heard from birth of our fortune to be born
into the good graces of bloody geometry.
And the people holding the compasses and protractors
are quick to call attention to the side of the experiential coin
that doesn't form imaginary sanguine lines in the soil,
perforated by the drunken geometer's shaky hands
as he
definitely he
plants the needle and whirls a stub of graphite
around this river or that mountain or this
exciting prospect of the Department of the Interior
So many circles to be drawn on looseleaf underlain by slippery formica
So the paper tears and we'll call it a river
Did you know they used to make paper out of human skin?
You call it an atlas; I call it a Necronomicon
But these geometers, so enamored of plucky opportunity
the intersection of which with personal happenstance they'll call "grit"
Will stab your fucking eyes out with their noble tools
as soon as you call it
privilege.
