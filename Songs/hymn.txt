He is risen!
See him grimace in the pungent cloud
Gaia's blessings!
From every sapling of her verdant crown

Today we celebrate this gift with all devotion!
Today we light the pyre high!
Today we celebrate your magic potions!
Today we step into the light!

When the men of science hit the arid desert
They figured just what to expect
The fire rising from the playa
It took the fruiting form of Death!

Today we question that association!
Today we feel our spirits grow!
Let go of all your fungal trepidation!
Bite the body, let it reformat your soul!

I've talked to better knowers, seeking shelter from the rain
I've tried them all to help me heal
I've walked the earth to find an end to earthly pain
Do you believe me when I tell you that it's real?!

The chemists sung of what they found when they created
That so pleasing to our souls
They only meant us live a life so unabated
Stick out your tongue and let it go!

Today we celebrate this gift with all devotion!
Today we light the pyre high!
Today we celebrate your magic potions!
Today we step into the light!
Today we celebrate this gift with all devotion!
Today we light the pyre high!
Today we celebrate your magic potions!
Today we step into the light!
