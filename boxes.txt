I've spent the time of most my life
entrapped in fleshy boxes
I've wondered, as I've looked around
the walls, mucosal in the light

And seen the the faces looking back
to pierce my fleshy agitprop-ses
"What's your pleasure?" with a wink
expecting things hedonic-like

But what they got instead was more
Along the lines of "ink"
Ink to wonder; ink to tell
How sad, banal, this hell of flesh

With sense and sensibility
Contrived and poured and cast in plaster
The sinews of existence strain
The loads they were not cast for

Which brings us to this lovers' box
Which meant for skin, but poured of mud
Will quiver, crumble, melt together
Become again such lum'nous blood
