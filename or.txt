OR not XOR


Satisfaction or stability? 
Joy or knowing when
You'll have another dollar in your pocket once again

Exploration of the bounds of what
We know and fear and love
Freedom? Supplication to the will of what's above?

A seltzer or a coffee
or a slushie from the store?
Or little harm-reductive choices that will surely hurt our lore?

A family or a calling
Or a quandry or some paperwork that'd really fool you all
I'll take my time to read it over (even backed against a wall)
Cause I'm a stickler for the logic and the it isn't even noon yet
How about I do it all? Cause bitch, my "or"s are Boolean
